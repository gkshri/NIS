Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
A network intrusion detection system that monitors bidirectional network traffic from various locations and reports statistical anomalies to a central decision making server

System Requirements
OS: Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)
Compiler: g++ (with C++11)
Compiling Instructions
Usage Instructions
Use ./desman [args] to run the desman server and specify how many watchdogs will be connecting.
The desman's IP address will be written to the console so the user can easily enter it as an argument when running the watchdogs.
Use ./watchdog [args] to run each individual watchdog client. (NOTE: when running a watchdog with the [-i interface] option, the user may need to elevate their permission level (via 'sudo ./watchdog...' or 'sudo su') to gain access to the device).
If no args (or invalid args) are provided for either, usage instructions will print to console along with an error message indicating which argument was invalid.
If the watchdogs are monitoring packets on a live interface, they will continue to run and send reports to the desman until terminated by user (via ctrl+c), or until the desman is terminated.
If the watchdogs are reading packets from a .pcap file, they will run until all reports are sent and then terminate.
Once all watchdogs have terminated, the desman will also terminate.
